# Pokemon Images MVP App.

## Exploring MVP design pattern Architecture.

I used the concept of this tutorial -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvp-model-view-presenter-architecture-pattern-in-android-with-example/ but instead of getting displaying random text, this project/App will be displaying random selections from 10 different pokemon images when the button is clicked via coil image loader.

Thanks to this medium post -> https://medium.com/android-news/taking-a-look-at-coil-217e1f02ef5e for guidance on using coil.
